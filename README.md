Pitch -- 
Allows you to compare music trends between countries/global


A little about the model -- 

As a user I want to be able to find the top 50 songs in a country and avg metrics 
I also want to see how those countries metrics compares to others and the world as a whole.

Then as a dev, I want to query the top 50 list of a country using spotify api.
We will query the songs in the playlist, then query those songs for the metrics.
That information will be stored in a postgresql/database, then we will display that information in some graphic form.
